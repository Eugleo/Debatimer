# Debatimer

_Debatimer used to be on the AppStore, but was eventually retracted (due to finantial reasons). We are discussing possibilities to add Debatimer back with the Czech Debate Federation._

With Debatimer you can focus on the thing that matters — the debate. Whether you are a coach, a lone referee or sit in the panel, you will surely find Debatimer the only debate companion you’ll ever need.
Debatimer does only one thing, but it does it well — it tracks time. Measuring speeches in Karl Popper debates has never been easier. You can see some screenshots of it [on this page](https://appadvice.com/app/debatimer-timer-for-debates/1349483608).

## Features

- Simple, zero-friction, elegant interface that doesn’t get in the way.
- Big smart button that keeps track of the current speaker; you only have to do the pushing.
- All measurements are visible at once, even after the debate. You don’t have to worry about the time until you want to.
